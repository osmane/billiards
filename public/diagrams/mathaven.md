# Mathaven ball cushion summary

This outlines a ball‚Äôs impact with a cushion analyzed with specific reference to the forces, velocities, and spins at play. Here's how the variables relate to the contact points I and C, as well as the velocities and spin components.

Contact Points:

* Point I: This is the primary contact point between the ball and the cushion.
* Point C: This is where the ball contacts the table surface during the collision

## Given inputs to the numerical approximation

```text
V‚ÇÄ: Initial velocity magnitude
Œ±: Angle relative to cushion with 0 being parallel and pi/2 perpendicular
œâ‚ÇÄT: Initial topspin angular velocity along line of travel of ball
œâ‚ÇÄS: Initial sidespin angular velocity
```

## Initial Conditions Equations

Centroid Velocities (Linear Velocities):

```text
(·∫ãG)‚ÇÅ = V‚ÇÄ cos(Œ±)     // Initial x velocity parallel to cushion
(·∫èG)‚ÇÅ = V‚ÇÄ sin(Œ±)  
(≈ºG)‚ÇÅ = 0            
```

Angular Velocities:

```text
(Œ∏Ãáx)‚ÇÅ = -œâ‚ÇÄT sin(Œ±)   // Initial angular velocity around x-axis
(Œ∏Ãáy)‚ÇÅ = œâ‚ÇÄT cos(Œ±)    // Initial angular velocity around y-axis
(Œ∏Ãáz)‚ÇÅ = œâ‚ÇÄS           // Initial angular velocity around z-axis (sidespin)
```
## Constants

* Coefficient of Restitution $e_e$: Value between the ball and cushion: 0.98
* Coefficient of Sliding Friction $Œº_s$ : Between the ball and table surface: 0.212
* Coefficient of Sliding Friction $Œº_w$ : Between the ball and cushion: 0.14
* Mass (M): 0.1406 kg
* Ball Radius (R): 26.25 mm

Cushion height in both snooker and pool, h = 7R/5, where R is the ball radius.
The common normal line Z at the contact point with the cushion makes an angle Œ∏ with the Y-axis, such that

* sinŒ∏ = 2/5 constant.
* cosŒ∏ = sqrt(21)/5 constant.

Slip Speed at Point I (cushion contact):

```text
s(0) = ‚àö[(V‚ÇÄ cos(Œ±) + R(œâ‚ÇÄT cos(Œ±)sinŒ∏ - œâ‚ÇÄS cosŒ∏))¬≤ + (-V‚ÇÄ sin(Œ±)sinŒ∏ - Rœâ‚ÇÄT sin(Œ±))¬≤]
```

Slip Speed at Point C (table contact):

```text
s'(0) = |V‚ÇÄ - Rœâ‚ÇÄT|
```

Slip Angle at Point I:

$\Phi$(0) = tan‚Åª¬π((-V‚ÇÄ sin(Œ±)sinŒ∏ - Rœâ‚ÇÄT sin(Œ±)) / (V‚ÇÄ cos(Œ±) + R(œâ‚ÇÄT cos(Œ±)sinŒ∏ - œâ‚ÇÄS cosŒ∏)))

Slip Angle at Point C:

$\Phi^{\prime}$(0) = Œ±            when V‚ÇÄ - Rœâ‚ÇÄT > 0

$\Phi^{\prime}$(0) = 180¬∞ + Œ±     when V‚ÇÄ - Rœâ‚ÇÄT < 0

undefined when V‚ÇÄ = Rœâ‚ÇÄT (rolling condition)

## Numerical Scheme for Ball-Cushion Impact Simulation Compression Phase

This section outlines the numerical scheme used to simulate the motion of a billiard ball during cushion impact, focusing on velocity changes and slip characteristics throughout the collision.

The numerical solution involves iteratively updating the state of the ball using small impulse increments ($\Delta P_I$). It's divided into two phases: compression and restitution.

**Compression Phase:** Continues as long as  `·∫è…¢ > 0` (ball is still moving towards the cushion).

**Restitution Phase:** Starts when `·∫è…¢ < 0` and continues until the calculated work done matches the target work for rebound calculated using the coefficient of restitution ($W_{Z'}^I(P_I^f) = (1 - e_e^2) W_{Z'}^I(P_I^c)$).


The core algorithm `updateSingleStep` is shared by both phases, handling the updates to velocities, angular velocities, and work done based on the equations above.

1. **Initialization**:
   * The scheme begins by calculating the initial centroidal velocities (center-of-mass velocities) and slip speeds and angles based on initial conditions.

2. **Velocity Increments**:
   * The algorithm updates the centroidal velocities of the ball using Equation (17a) along with five additional simultaneous equations.
   * Equation (17a) for the x-component velocity increment
   * Additional equations for y-components account for changes in these directions as the impulse accumulates. The z component is assumed zero.

3. **Slip Velocities Calculation**:
   * New slip velocities are computed using updated values from equations (12a), (12b), (13a), and (13b), which relate slip velocities at the cushion and table to the ball‚Äôs centroidal velocities.

4. **Rolling Condition Check**:
   * The algorithm includes logic to adjust calculations if a rolling condition (no-slip state) is reached at either the cushion or table contacts, as defined by Equations (15a) and (15b).

5. **Work Done Calculation**:
   * Work done by the normal force at the contact point $I$ along the $Z'$-axis is calculated using Equation (16a) and stored for analysis

This iterative algorithm captures the changes in the ball‚Äôs velocity and spin during impact, with stored values enabling further analysis of trajectory variations due to friction and cushion effects.

The numerical scheme is initially stopped when $\dot{z}_I = 0$ (i.e., when the compression phase has ended), A simpler condition is when the ball stops moving toward the cushion i.e.

$$
yÃá_G < 0
$$

the corresponding value of work done is obtained from the array containing

$W_{Z'}^I$ which will be $W_{Z'}^I(P_I^c)$

Now, using Equation (16b), the value $W_{Z'}^I(P_I^f)$ can be calculated, given that $e_e$ is known:

$$W_{Z'}^I(P_I^f) = (1 - e_e^2) W_{Z'}^I(P_I^c)$$

## Restitution Phase

The numerical process of incrementing $P_I$ can resume again, and when $W_{Z'}^I = W_{Z'}^I(P_I^f)$, the process is terminated.

In order to start the numerical scheme, a reasonable estimate for $\Delta P_I$ has to be assumed. An approximate value for $P_I^f$ can be assumed to be $(1 + e_e) M V_0 \sin \alpha$ , which is the value of the final accumulated normal impulse for a horizontally moving, non-spinning ball colliding into a solid vertical wall.

Hence, approximately for $N$ iterations, $\Delta P_I = \frac{(1 + e_e) M V_0 \sin \alpha}{N}$. Obviously, the values of $P_I^c$ and $P_I^f$ will determine the actual number of iterations that take place in the scheme. An initial $N$ of 5000 worked satisfactorily for the scheme.

The paper outlines an algorithm for compression phase while $yÃá_G > 0$

1. CALCULATE INITIAL $s, \Phi, s', \Phi'$
   ESTIMATE $\Delta \dot{x}_G, \ldots, \Delta \dot{\theta}_z$
   *(Use Eqns. 15 and 17)*

2. $\dot{x}_G = \dot{x}_G + \Delta \dot{x}_G$
   $\dot{\theta}_z = \dot{\theta}_z + \Delta \dot{\theta}_z$

3. RECALCULATE $s, \Phi, s', \Phi'$
   *(Use Eqns. 12 and 13)*

4. UPDATE $\dot{X}_G , \ldots, \dot{\theta}_z$

5. ESTIMATE $\Delta W^z$   *(Use Eqn. 16a)*   $W^z = W^z + \Delta W^z$

## Code generation prompt

Generate TypeScript code for simulating billiard ball dynamics based on cushion impacts, referencing equations from the paper. The code should focus on modularity and readability, implementing a core algorithm to update `State` for both compression and restitution phases, and leveraging shared methods between phases.

Assumptions:
- Use concise, readable TypeScript with minimal inline comments.
- Comments should reference specific equations from the paper, focusing on relevance rather than extensive explanation.
- Implement state updates for both phases within a single `updateSingleStep` function, called by both `compressionPhase` and `restitutionPhase` methods.

Imports are predefined and assumed as shown below and should not be repeated in the solution.
